## Background

I got annoyed re-writing the same utility boilerplate across multiple projects.  This project is designed to help de-duplicate general, nonspecific utility code. 

## Install

There will be Cloudsmith releases published soon (tm). Users can clone the repository, and build manually using the provided Gradle wrapper.

## Usage

Toolkit uses Java 17 and Gradle 7.4.
